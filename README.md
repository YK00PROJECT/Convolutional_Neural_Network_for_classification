# Animal Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

This repository contains code for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of various animals. The dataset consists of images belonging to 10 different classes: scoiattolo (squirrel), cane (dog), ragno (spider), mucca (cow), gatto (cat), gallina (chicken), elefante (elephant), farfalla (butterfly), cavallo (horse), and pecora (sheep).

## Requirements

To run this code, you need the following libraries and tools:

- TensorFlow 2.12.0
- Keras
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab (optional, for running on Colab environment)

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The dataset should be organized in a directory structure where each class has its own folder containing images.
   - The main directory should contain subdirectories for train, val (validation), and test sets.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Image data augmentation is performed using the `ImageDataGenerator` class from Keras.
   - The training, validation, and test sets are preprocessed and normalized.

3. **Model Building:**
   - The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers.
   - Batch normalization is applied after each convolutional layer to stabilize and speed up the training process.

4. **Model Training:**
   - The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function.
   - Training is performed with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
   - The training history is saved for analysis.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The trained model is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance.
   - Test accuracy and loss are reported.

6. **Prediction:**
   - You can use the trained model to make predictions on new images.
   - Provide the path to the test image, and the model will output the predicted class.
